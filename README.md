[00:00.31] Hello everyone!
[00:01.83] I'm Hatsune Miku, a virtual Idol
[00:05.22] Well... That's what everyone seems to think
[00:07.34] But secretly, I'm- (hehe)
[00:19.84] 
[00:09.72] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, fighter!
[00:12.34] Super powerful Miku-chan
[00:14.79] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, cyber!
[00:17.31] Miku, Miku, Miku, go!
[00:27.81] 
[00:19.68] I wake up to a call, put my frilly outfit on now
[00:22.39] It's time I open up my eyes and start the day
[00:24.66] I combat 'til the dawn, until every villain's gone, WAH!
[00:27.34] A clumsy trip and now I've fallen to my butt
[00:29.69] With my magical phone and a silly little ringtone
[00:32.55] I'll shout a magic word and set the world in place
[00:34.61] Whatever it may cost, there's no reason to stop
[00:37.09] For a world that I cherish and love
[00:54.59] 
[00:38.86] Monsters might be a scary foe to fight
[00:42.73] But I'll take the stand
[00:44.63] If I can stop your tears and wipe them dry
[00:47.24] (I'll make you feel magical)
[01:01.24] 
[00:49.19] If my pain's a type of cure for peace, I don't mind
[00:51.74] I can play as a nurse healing you everyday
[00:54.69] So what if I might shed a tear, get some bruises?
[00:57.05] A wipe is all I need to clean the cherry blush away, ha!
[00:59.94] Fighting through the night, but I'm wide awake
[01:01.79] It can all be so hard for me to get through the day
[01:04.39] Your smile is enough to heal all my aches
[01:06.75] Wrapped in a cute bandaid
[01:19.25] 
[01:09.34] I can take the pain, fight all day, fill up the syringe with love
[01:12.71] Heal up the world and go again
[01:27.71] 
[01:14.84] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, fighter!
[01:17.16] Super powerful Miku-chan
[01:19.86] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, cyber!
[01:22.15] Miku, Miku, Miku, go!
[01:32.65] 
[01:25.00] And now, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for!
[01:29.86] One, two, three
[01:33.41] Ready?
[01:34.29] Miku, Miku BEAM! (Keep going!)
[01:49.29] 
[01:43.97] On my own, without anyone to know
[01:47.99] How my job's not all rainbows
[01:50.27] But then, I think about your smile
[01:52.32] (Your words are so lyrical)
[02:05.82] 
[01:54.22] I'm a magically bright invincible girl
[01:56.88] If you need me to heal, go on and call out my name
[01:59.46] When you find yourself going down a spiral
[02:02.04] I'll bonk away what puts you down, a pink hammer melee, ya!
[02:04.67] Fighting through the night, but I'm wide awake
[02:06.71] All alone, it's so hard for me to get through the rain
[02:09.67] Your smile is enough to make my day
[02:11.98] So I stand tall and brave
[02:24.48] 
[02:14.37] 'Cause I'm not afraid, any pain, I can laugh away, chin up
[02:17.55] With love, I'll fight on 'til the end
[02:36.05] 
[02:39.93] Bearing through the pain, I try to be brave
[02:44.65] As long as you can stay happy, I'm okay
[02:48.30] I'm not gonna bend, ha!
[02:59.80] 
[02:49.99] I can be a cure for peace in your heart
[02:51.74] And I'll play as a nurse healing you every day
[02:54.70] Your smile is enough to heal all my aches
[02:56.73] All in a cute bandaid
[03:07.23] 
[02:59.38] If you're feeling pain, call my name, I'll be by your side
[03:01.92] 'Til I see your smile beam bright again
[03:21.42] 
[03:04.86] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, fighter!
[03:07.25] Super powerful Miku-chan
[03:09.77] うりゃ おい! うりゃ おい! Ooh, cyber!
[03:12.13] Miku, Miku, Miku, go!
[03:22.63] 
[03:15.85] ああ... 眠いよ
